Pick the Worker Group or Edge Fleet you are interested in from the drop down above. \n2. Select your route, pack, or pipeline that you're intested in from the additional drop downs. These three filters only impact their associated tables. \n3. For Cribl Pipelines: in order to see the contents of a particular pipeline, ensure that you select them in the filter. The detailed table will not populate unless a filter is selected.Note: It is recommended to review the pipeline contents within Cribl Stream once you have narrowed down which pipeline is applicable. The views there are much easier to interpret.\n","axis":{}},"id":"jn8llfltr","layout":{"x":0,"y":0,"w":12,"h":3},"variant":"markdown","type":"markdown.default"},{"config":{},"search":{"type":"inline","query":"${cribl_stream_inventory} endpointName=\"cribl_inputs\" worker_group=$worker_group | summarize by id, type, disabled, pipeline, port, status.health | project-away count_","earliest":"-1h","latest":"now"},"id":"74z4r4wxz","layout":{"x":0,"y":3,"w":12,"h":4},"type":"list.table","title":"Cribl Inputs"},{"config":{},"search":{"type":"inline","query":"${cribl_stream_inventory} endpointName=\"cribl_outputs\" worker_group=$worker_group | summarize by id, type, pipeline, port, status.health | project-away count_","earliest":"-1h","latest":"now"},"id":"74z4r4wxz-copy","layout":{"x":0,"y":7,"w":12,"h":4},"type":"list.table","title":"Cribl Outputs"},{"config":{},"search":{"type":"inline","query":"${cribl_stream_inventory} worker_group=$worker_group endpointName=\"cribl_routes\" name=\"$route_filter\" | summarize by worker_group, name, filter, pipeline, output | project-away count_","earliest":"-1h","latest":"now"},"id":"tft59g040","layout":{"x":0,"y":11,"w":12,"h":4},"type":"list.table","title":"Cribl Routes"},{"config":{},"search":{"type":"inline","earliest":"-1h","latest":"now","query":"${cribl_stream_inventory} endpointName=\"cribl_pipelines\" worker_group=$worker_group id=$pipeline_filter  | extend functions=conf.functions\n| mv-expand functions\n| project worker_group, pipeline_id, functions.id, functions.description, functions.filter, functions.conf, functions.final\n| render table"},"id":"49rogsdfb","layout":{"x":0,"y":15,"w":12,"h":4},"type":"list.table","title":"Cribl Pipeline"},{"config":{},"search":{"type":"inline","query":"${cribl_stream_inventory} endpointName=\"cribl_packs\" worker_group=$worker_group id=$pack_filter | summarize by displayName, description, author, version | project-away count_","earliest":"-1h","latest":"now"},"id":"54pckin5s","layout":{"x":0,"y":19,"w":12,"h":4},"type":"list.table","title":"Cribl Packs"}],"description":"Displays information about worker groups, routes, pipelines, and packs."}
