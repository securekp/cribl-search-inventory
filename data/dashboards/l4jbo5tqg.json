Pick the Worker Group and Pack you are interested in from the drop down above. \n2. For Cribl Pipelines: in order to see the contents of a particular pipeline, ensure that you select them in the filter. The detailed table will not populate unless a filter is selected.Note: It is recommended to review the pipeline contents within Cribl Stream once you have narrowed down which pipeline is applicable. The views there are much easier to interpret.\n","axis":{}},"id":"7ws5tcx20","layout":{"x":0,"y":0,"w":12,"h":2},"variant":"markdown","type":"markdown.default"},{"config":{},"search":{"type":"inline","query":"${cribl_packs} worker_group=$worker_group pack=$pack_name endpointName=\"cribl_packs_inputs\" | summarize by id, type, disabled, pipeline, port, status.health | project-away count_","earliest":"-1h","latest":"now"},"id":"wx43fwgzl","layout":{"x":0,"y":2,"w":12,"h":4},"type":"list.table","title":"Cribl Inputs in $pack_name"},{"config":{},"search":{"type":"inline","query":"${cribl_packs} worker_group=$worker_group pack=$pack_name endpointName=\"cribl_packs_outputs\" | summarize by id, type, pipeline, port, status.health | project-away count_","earliest":"-1h","latest":"now"},"id":"wx43fwgzl-copy","layout":{"x":0,"y":6,"w":12,"h":4},"type":"list.table","title":"Cribl Outputs in $pack_name"},{"config":{},"search":{"type":"inline","query":"${cribl_packs} worker_group=$worker_group pack=$pack_name endpointName=\"cribl_packs_routes\" | summarize by name, disabled, filter, pipeline, output | project-away count_","earliest":"-1h","latest":"now"},"id":"wulofe4dk","layout":{"x":0,"y":10,"w":12,"h":4},"type":"list.table","title":"Cribl Routes in $pack_name"},{"config":{},"search":{"type":"inline","query":"${cribl_packs} endpointName=\"cribl_packs_pipelines\" worker_group=$worker_group pack=$pack_name id=$pipeline_name  | extend functions=conf.functions\n| mv-expand functions\n| project id, functions.id, functions.description, functions.filter, functions.conf, functions.final\n| render table","earliest":"-1h","latest":"now"},"id":"f0gvgk546","layout":{"x":0,"y":14,"w":12,"h":4},"type":"list.table","title":"Cribl Pipeline $pipeline_name in $pack_name"}],"createdBy":"google-oauth2|102344156790540243001","modifiedBy":"google-oauth2|102344156790540243001","modified":1766002233726,"created":1766000396625,"displayCreatedBy":"Kelsey Prior","displayModifiedBy":"Kelsey Prior"}
